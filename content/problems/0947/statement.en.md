The $(a,b,m)$-sequence, where $0 \leq a,b \lt m$, is defined as

$\begin{align*} g(0)&=a\\ g(1)&=b\\ g(n)&= \big(g(n-1) + g(n-2)\big) \bmod m \end{align*}$

All $(a,b,m)$-sequences are periodic with period denoted by $p(a,b,m)$.
The first few terms of the $(0,1,8)$-sequence are $(0,1,1,2,3,5,0,5,5,2,7,1,0,1,1,2,\ldots )$ and so $p(0,1,8)=12$.

Let $\displaystyle s(m)=\sum_{a=0}^{m-1}\sum_{b=0}^{m-1} p(a,b,m)^2$. For example, $s(3)=513$ and $s(10)=225820$.

Define $\displaystyle S(M)=\sum_{m=1}^{M}s(m)$. You are given, $S(3)=542$ and $S(10)=310897$.

Find $S(10^6)$. Give your answer modulo $999\,999\,893$.
