Two players X and O play a game with $k$ strips of squares of lengths $n_1,\dots,n_k$, originally all blank.

Starting with X, they make moves in turn. At X's turn, X draws an "X" symbol; at O's turn, O draws an "O" symbol.
The symbol must be drawn in one blank square with either red or blue pen, subject to the following restrictions:

two symbols in adjacent squares on one strip must be different symbols and must have different colour;
if there is at least one blank strip, then one must draw on a blank strip.

Whoever does not have a valid move loses the game.

Let $P(K, N)$ be the number of tuples $(n_1,\dots,n_k)$ such that $1 \leq k \leq K$, $1\leq n_1\leq\cdots\leq n_k\leq N$ and that X has a winning strategy to the corresponding game.
For example, $P(2, 4)=7$ and $P(5, 10) = 901$.

Find $P(10^7, 10^7)\bmod 1234567891$.
